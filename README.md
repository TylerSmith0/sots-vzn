# Saviors of the Sea

This web application is home to the Saviors of the Sea NFT project. It served as the official homepage for the project, which has since been deprecated.

I used this particular project to learn as much as I could about web applications using the Django framework. I messed a lot of things up, and broke countless features I had included, but in the end it was a working application that served information on the project, included in-browser mini-games with score logging, and securely handled form input for minting and registering for an NFT token.
